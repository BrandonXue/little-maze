# little-maze

## Introduction
A program that displays a generated maze, and a bot that runs through the maze. The program is written in Javascript with an HTML web page for display. The project uses the p5.js library.
The maze will have no loops or islands. This allows the bot to use the left-hand rule, leaving a path (without side dead-ends) from the start to the exit.
